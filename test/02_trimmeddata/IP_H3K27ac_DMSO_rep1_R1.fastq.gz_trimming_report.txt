Input filename: /work/xulab/xulab-seq/sfr/scripts/ChIP-Rx-pipeline/test/00_rawdata/IP_H3K27ac_DMSO_rep1_R1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.7
Cutadapt version: 4.2
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 25
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'CTGTCTCTTATACAC' (user defined)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Optional adapter 2 sequence (only used for read 2 of paired-end files): 'CTGTCTCTTATACAC'
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 4 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 36 bp
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 34 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 10 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases (e.g. M-bias for BS-Seq applications)
Output file will be GZIP compressed
